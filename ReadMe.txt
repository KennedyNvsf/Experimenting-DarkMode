This Mock up is a simple Starbucks landing page with a basic javascript product switcher.


The design was inspired by the Youtube Channel :https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkjoHfkLEy7ZT4bA2myJ8xA


For this project i used html 5 semantics
sass
and an external javascript file for the interactivity.



also a big thank you to EASY Tutorials for the smart ideas.
